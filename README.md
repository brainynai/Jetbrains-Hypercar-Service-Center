This project was completed as part of the Jetbrains Academy Python track. The objective of this project was to implement a rudimentary web interface for a hypothetical automotive service shop where customers could join a waiting list for services and be given an expected wait time based on the prioritized queue and estimated lead time on each time of service. 

This project used the Django framework.
